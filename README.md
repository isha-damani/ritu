# Ritu — A Gentle Cycle Tracker

Ritu is a **privacy-first, rule-based menstrual cycle tracker** designed to help users understand their cycle in a calm, respectful, and non-clinical way. The project focuses on clarity and awareness rather than medical predictions, making it suitable for everyday self-tracking without overwhelm.

---

## 🌸 Problem Statement

Many existing period tracking apps feel overwhelming, overly clinical, or make strong predictive claims that can cause unnecessary anxiety. There is a need for a **simple and gentle tool** that allows users to track their cycle, notice patterns, and build awareness — without medical language or intrusive features.

Ritu addresses this by providing a clean interface, transparent logic, and complete local data storage.
